On start - 

Pull up a start up menu, just a simple text box. It will have options as follows:

Campaign
Arena
Versus
Chaos Mode
Options
Exit

None of them will do anything right now. But can make Versus start my testing mode for now. 

Exit will obviously close the program. Then it will pull up the full sized UI.
