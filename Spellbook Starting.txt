Have a "Devotion" mechanic to unlock spells? You gain +1 devotion for each ranked game you meet a certain prerequisite (cannot quit the game early) and once you hit a 
	certain threshold for Devotion, you unlock certain spells. So for example, Fire devotion might require reaching 10 fire mana
	and it might require 2-3 devotion for many basic fire spells, but perhaps 30 devotion for the hardest ones or even
	50-100. Maybe 100 Devotion for the most OP spells in the game in each magic type. Have like 1-2 legendary spells for
	each magic type. 

Have like... 10-15 Spell slots, and you can cast as many spells as you are allowed based on whatever spells and their rarity. If you run out of spells to cast, you lose in 3 turns.
